/**
 * Shifts execution to a dedicated thread pool
 *
 * This is needed for running blocking JDBC operations. Inspired by Doobie's threading model:
 *
 * > The reason for having separate pools for awaiting connections and executing JDBC operations is
 * > liveness - we must avoid the situation where all the threads in the pool are blocked on
 * > acquiring a JDBC connection, meaning that no logical threads are able to make progress and
 * > release the connection theyâ€™re currently holding.
 *
 * See https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/docs/14-Managing-Connections.html#about-threading
 *
 * This typeclass is a bit of a hack while we are supporting Id and IO instances. It should be
 * removed when we deprecate stream-enrich.
