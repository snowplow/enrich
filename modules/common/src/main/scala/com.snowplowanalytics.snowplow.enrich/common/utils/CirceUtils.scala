   * how `Long` is deserialized. The original mapper maps a `Long` to `JsonBigDecimal`
   * whereas this custom mapper deserializes a `Long` to `JsonLong`.
   *
   * This customization saves Snowplow events from failing when derived contexts are
   * validated post-enrichment. If output schema of API Request Enrichment has an integer
   * field, `JsonBigDecimal` representation of a Long results in a bad row
   * with message `number found, integer expected` in Iglu Scala Client, since jackson
   * treats `DecimalNode` as number in all cases.
